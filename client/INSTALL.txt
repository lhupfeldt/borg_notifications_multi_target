--- Client installation ---

First follow the client/server common instructions for installing borgbackup in ../INSTALL.txt

Then install the 'bbmt' command:

# Linux (Fedora 23):
sudo python3 setup.py install --user

# OS X:
sudo -H /opt/local/bin/python3 setup.py install --user

-- Configuration --

ssh-keygen (no password)  # If you want to make a new ssh key or don't have any
# The ssh key must be added to the server accounts 'authorized_keys'

Run 'bbmt' to generated a config template in the correct location
Edit the template as mentioned in the bbmt command output to set the key and server information


# Initialize a new repository
export BORG_RSH="ssh -i ~/.ssh/<private-key>"  # If you are not using standard id_rsa key file name
borg init --encryption=keyfile backup@<your-backup-host>:backup


run ./bin/backup/client/backup.py to test

# MAKE SURE to backup keys and passwords to offline media or your backup is useless!
rsync -av --exclude __pycache__ --exclude '*~' --relative ~/./.gnupg ~/./.ssh ~/./bin/backup/client/{config.py,*.conf} <cd, dvd, usb multiple!>


--- Update your personal crontab ---
Use the command 'crontab -e' to edit crontab
This will run backup between 00:00 and 03:00 and after a reboot, change to your liking

# Linux:
@reboot sleep 180 && bbmt
@daily sleep $(( $RANDOM \% 60 * 180 )) && bbmt

# Mac:
@reboot sleep 180 /opt/local/bin/python3.4 bin/backup/client/backup.py
@daily sleep $(( $RANDOM \% 60 * 180 )) && /opt/local/bin/python3.4 bin/backup/client/backup.py

--- Setting up email ---

# Linux:
1) Add MAILTO=<an email account that you read> to the top of crontab (crontab -e)
2) Configure postfix (or another mail transfer agent) -
   sudo dnf install postfix
   Follow instructions like these for gmail: http://freelinuxtutorials.com/quick-tips-and-tricks/configure-postfix-to-use-gmail-in-rhelcentos/

# Mac:
